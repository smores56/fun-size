Fun Size
========

The Fun Size is an ergonomic keyboard PCB. With 32 to 36 keys, it uses Kailh hotswap sockets to
support Choc v1 switches, in addition to up to 4 EVQWGD001 horizontal rotary encoders.

The first version has had prototypes ordered for testing and depiction here using the
[gerber archive][./v1/fun-size.zip] saved in this repo. Once it arrives, pictures will be uploaded
here.

Check back later for QMK configuration to run your own.
